successfully started a django project
- to run it simply navigate to outer what2eat folder and write "python manage.py runserver" in terminal 
- you will get a link in the terminal that starts with http://ip-number-for-your-pc/portnumber/ not 100% correct (IP and portnumber, but looks like it)
- paste this link in browser and you will see a page that says "the install worked successfully"
